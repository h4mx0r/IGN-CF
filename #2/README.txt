Code Foo Problem #2
------------------------
Create a liquid layout with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This layout must support the following resolutions: 1024x768, 1680x1050. Explain why you would use a liquid layout. 
------------------------
A liquid layout has the benefit of resizing itself to fit one's screen resolution while keeping most proportions of the website intact for the viewer. All the elements will re-size and in some cases(if programmed to do so via CSS and/or Javascript), reposition themselves to better accommodate a user's viewing resolution. This way, nothing is lost, the need for a horizontal scroll bar is eliminated and the page becomes much more user friendly!

That being said, Fixed Width pages still have their uses, but for the most part, liquid layouts are much more user friendly.

Coincidentally I started self-learning HTML/CSS/Javascript around the time I heard about Code Foo. Talk about a great motivator!
