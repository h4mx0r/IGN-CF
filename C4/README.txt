What you see before you is a java file that creates a functional CONNECT FOUR game. It will detect a win via horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.

Unfortunately, the AI is nothing more than a random number generator. HOWEVER, the game does function correctly through my own test cases, so really if I had some more time I could have given an actual AI a shot.

As it stands though, at least I can show you my Connect Four java game.

(There's no GUI, it's played in the console)
